    <h1>Desert Fairy</h1>
    <p>
      A fairy is a supposed magical being that flies in the air. They are
      usually depicted as small girls or women. Some faries have certain jobs,
      such as the Tooth fairy, who gives money or treats under the pillow of
      small children who have had a tooth fall out.
